Clone a remote repo:

====>  git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git

This creates a local copy of the project on your computer.

Make changes locally:
You edit files, add new code, or fix bugs in your local working directory.

Stage and commit locally:

===========>git add .
===========>git commit -m "Added new feature"

Push to the remote repository:

============>git push origin main

This sends your committed changes to the remote repository on GitHub (or wherever it's hosted).

Pull the latest changes:

=============>git pull origin main

    This updates your local repository with any new commits made by others to the remote repository.

Summary

    Local repository: The version of your repository on your own computer. Itâ€™s where you do your work and make commits.
    Remote repository: The version of your repository stored on a server or cloud platform (e.g., GitHub). It is shared with other contributors and is used for collaboration, backups, and distribution.

By working with both local and remote repositories, you can manage changes in your project effectively, both individually and in a team environment.
